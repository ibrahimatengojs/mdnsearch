# mdnsearch

Ever been working along on a JavaScript project but you forgot just how that one native method works?  Never fear, MDN Search is here!  It's a simple console application that will search the MDN for what you want

Searches the Mozilla Developer Network for a given argument.  Example:

```
pb-mdn arrays
```

Will open a new search at the MDN for arrays.

# Install

```
npm install -g pb-mdn
```
